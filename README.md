# Bleeding Edge Press Simple Drone Surveyor

## What this is
This is a simple app to allow an unmanned air system (a drone or UAS) to fly basic patterns using frameworks and principles discussed in Deconstructing Drones for Developers, a book published by [Bleeding Edge Press](http://bleedingedgepress.com/).  This app is meant to be platform independent, though running it on a UAS capable of fully autonomous flight would be ideal.  This package can also run completely in software, via simulator  

## Who this is for
Any Developer looking to learn more about developing for flying robots.  Those looking for a good starting point to develop their own projects can use this code as well.  

## Why is this useful?
This demo provides a proof of concept for the book, as well as an excellent starting point for software developers new to the field of aerial robotics
